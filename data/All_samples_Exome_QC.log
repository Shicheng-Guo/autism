Warning: Ignoring phenotypes of missing-sex samples.  If you don't want those
phenotypes to be ignored, use the --allow-no-sex flag.

Warning: 29050 het. haploid genotypes present (see All_samples_Exome_QC.hh );
many commands treat these as missing.
Warning: Nonmissing nonmale Y chromosome genotype(s) present; many commands
treat these as missing.
Total genotyping rate is 0.969768.
2650541 variants and 256 people pass filters and QC.
Among remaining phenotypes, 0 are cases and 137 are controls.  (119 phenotypes
are missing.)
--recode vcf to All_samples_Exome_QC.vcf ... done.
Warning: At least one VCF allele code violates the official specification;
other tools may not accept the file.  (Valid codes must either start with a
'<', only contain characters in {A,C,G,T,N,a,c,g,t,n}, be an isolated '*', or
represent a breakend.)
